# LedMatrix
Code and photos for a 8x5 led matrix that is controlled with an Arduino and wirelessly controlled with an ESP 8266.

The added documentation is in talks about components chosen to make the matrix, and describes the code used to drive the matrix. Also it contains photos of the project.
I dont have a good looking circuit diagram to add.
